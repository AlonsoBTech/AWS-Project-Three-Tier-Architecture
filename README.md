## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

Creating a highly available, scalable and secure AWS Three Tier Architecture for a web application. A three tier architecture offers
better scalability, flexibility and even maintainability and even cost efficiency. As each tier is sepearted we can use less intensive
resources where need and use more high performance resources where required, this allows for us to optimize how we spend on our resources.
Security is one of the key features here as well, since each tier is seperated we can tailor our security procedures better mitigating
the risk for vulnerabilities.
