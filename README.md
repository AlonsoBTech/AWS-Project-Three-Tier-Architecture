## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

Creating a highly available, scalable and secure AWS Three Tier Architecture for a web application. A three tier architecture offers
better scalability, flexibility and even maintainability and even cost efficiency. As each tier is sepearted we can allocate less intensive
resources to lower tiers and use more high performance resources where required, this allows for us to optimize how we manage our infrastructure cost.
Security is one of the key features here as well, with each tier isolated we can implement tailored security measures to help effectively mitigate
the risk for vulnerabilities.
